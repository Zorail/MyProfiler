RxJava2+MVP+Dependency Injection+FireBase

This app I made by learning the approach to MVP architecture .
I have used RxJava2 for the management of asynchronous calls to FireBase.

This app is still over development process,I am still learing and will be updating this repo soon.


Thanks to WiseAss sir ,I am your fan now :)
